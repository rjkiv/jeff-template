jeff Project Template
===============================

If starting a new Xbox 360 decompilation project, this repository can be used as a scaffold.

See [jeff](https://github.com/rjkiv/jeff) for background on the concept and more information on the tooling used.

Although this template is meant for Xbox 360 projects, it has been forked from a GC/Wii template, and intentionally follows the same structure.
Nearly all active GC/Wii decompilation projects use this structure, and will be useful
for reference. A list of active GC/Wii projects can be found on [decomp.dev](https://decomp.dev).

Features
--------

- Few external dependencies: Just `python` for the generator and `ninja` for the build system. See [Dependencies](docs/dependencies.md).
- Simple configuration: Everything lives in `config.yml`, `symbols.txt`, and `splits.txt`.
- Multi-version support: Separate configurations for each game version, and a `configure.py --version` flag to switch between them.
- Feature-rich analyzer: Many time-consuming tasks are automated, allowing you to focus on the decompilation itself.
- No manual assembly: decomp-toolkit handles splitting the XEX into relocatable objects based on the configuration. No game assets are committed to the repository.
- Integration with [objdiff](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff) for a diffing workflow.

COMING SOON(TM):
- Progress calculation and integration with [decomp.dev](https://decomp.dev).
- CI workflow template for GitHub Actions.

Project structure
-----------------

- `configure.py` - Project configuration and generator script.
- `config/[GAMEID]` - Configuration files for each game version.
- `config/[GAMEID]/build.sha1` - SHA-1 hashes for each built artifact, for final verification.
- `build/` - Build artifacts generated by the the build process. Ignored by `.gitignore`.
- `orig/[GAMEID]` - Original game files, extracted from the disc. Ignored by `.gitignore`.
- `orig/[GAMEID]/.gitkeep` - Empty checked-in file to ensure the directory is created on clone.
- `src/` - C/C++ source files.
- `include/` - C/C++ header files.
- `tools/` - Scripts shared between projects.

Temporary, delete when done:

- `config/GAMEID/config.example.yml` - Example configuration file and documentation.
- `docs/` - Documentation for decomp-toolkit configuration.
- `README.md` - This file, replace with your own. For a template, see [`README.example.md`](README.example.md).
- `LICENSE` - This repository is licensed under the CC0 license. Replace with your own if desired.
